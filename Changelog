2020.606:

 * Check for option key length and valid keywords.

 * Allow supplying _program for the program name instead of
   sys.srgv[0].

 * Allow supplying _usage for the usage message instead of the
   constructed one.

 * Gave up the under 10 KB code goal; hope to keep it under 16 KB
   (which may leave space for some improvements like more error
   checking and things).

2020.528:

 * Spec change: option discriptor must now be a tuple; _arguments
   value must now be a string (as before) or a list. See README.

2020.525:

 * Got rid of the f"..." strings for compatibility with Python 3.5
 
   I *like* the f"..." strings, but I still have one server, and not
   an unimportant one, still running under Debian 9 with Python 3.5.
   This was, actually, a bit of a pain.

2020.524:

 * First public release
