2020-829:

 * Removed the terminal_size() function as I learned about
   os.get_terminal_size(), which has the exact same call signature,
   except it doesn't swallow the OSError exception when stdout is
   not a terminal.

 * function flatten() to flatten sequences (e.g. for counting)

 * functions is_int(), maybe_int()

 * functions isotime(), iso_time(), iso_time_ms(), iso_time_us() for
   formatting ISO time strings; also optional timestamps for alerts

Never mind previous versions.
