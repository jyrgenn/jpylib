Also see Changelog-pgetopt for pgetopt changes.

2020-1011:

 * context manager temporary_alert_level()

2020-920:

 * Singleton metaclass

 * Alert functions tracef, debugf, infof, noticef, errorf, fatalf
   that print according to their level, taking a format string
   argument and the format parameters.

2020-910:

 * Table alignment argument now a string only, consisting of one or
   two alignment descriptors, comma-separated, for either both or
   the first and following rows.

2020-901:

 * Table formatter

 * functions is_num(), maybe_num() (for floats as well as ints)

2020-829:

 * Removed the terminal_size() function as I learned about
   os.get_terminal_size(), which has the exact same call signature,
   except it doesn't swallow the OSError exception when stdout is
   not a terminal.

 * function flatten() to flatten sequences (e.g. for counting)

 * functions is_int(), maybe_int()

 * functions isotime(), iso_time(), iso_time_ms(), iso_time_us() for
   formatting ISO time strings; also optional timestamps for alerts

Never mind previous versions.
