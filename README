pgetopt -- Python package for POSIX-compatible command-line option
parsing, plus long options.

I wrote this not because there wasn't any option parsing package
available in Python -- I know there are a few --, but because I
didn't like those I saw. Argparse, Optparse, Click, they all do too
much for my taste, and at the same time are IMO cumbersome to use.

What I want is a really simple user interface, one that makes simple
things simple. I don't want to do everything ever imaginable, or
automate sophisticated argument verification in an option parser. I
want it to parse the options, with potential arguments, and

TODO: An option and its argument may or may not appear as separate
tokens. (In other words, the whitespace separating them is
optional.) Thus, ‘-o foo’ and ‘-ofoo’ are equivalent.


TODO:

If the SYNOPSIS of a standard utility shows an option with a
mandatory option-argument (as with [ -c option_argument] in the
example), a conforming application shall use separate arguments for
that option and its option-argument. However, a conforming
implementation shall also permit applications to specify the option
and option-argument in the same argument string without intervening
<blank> characters.
